# odin-recipes

Hi, this is my first HTML project, and, in general, my first real project. 
What I will try to demostrate is that I know the main syntax for HTML and I'm 
able to create something from zero. 

What I will do is a page with the recipe for the neapolitan pizza. 

I will try to take inspiration from other websites and create something quite good. 

Remember, i want to use all the knowledge that i have acquired since now. 
I also want to add images, links, etc. 
ok bye
